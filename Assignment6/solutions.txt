a) The two operations that cannot be pipelined are adding to 'sum' and incrementing i because they depend on the variable 
'i' being updated every iteration through the for loop and cannot start until the previous value has finished being 
calculated.  

b) the best case cycles per element is 3 because thats the latency of the slowest operation that cannot be pipelined.

d) Inner2 is more efficient than inner because it uses four way loop unrolling with 4 parallel accumulators so that it
wastes less time with loop overhead such as incrementing i and conditional checks to stay in the loop. When I tested
inner and inner2 with array lengths from 10 to 100000, I found that inner2 ran almost 2x faster than inner every time.
